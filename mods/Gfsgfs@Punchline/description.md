## Welcome to the Puncline mod !!
This mod contains 38 jokers and many more on the way (note that "many more on the way" won't be a feature avaible in the future).
This mod also contains brand new consumables with mystical powers sure to make you outsmart your foes and blablabla its a Balatro mod its not that deep just enjoy.

## Why should you play this mod ?
Its cool and awsome, actually let me ask YOU a question why should you play anything you can just stay at home in your bed, rotting away and letting the years go by, making no memories no friends and only being remembered in passing by people that could have cared about you.

## What?
Sorry i just dont know how to make a good description because i added jokers and new consumables like that's it.

## You know what i'll play your mod ok ?
Thanks.
